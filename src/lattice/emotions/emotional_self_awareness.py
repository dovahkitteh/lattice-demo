Emotional Self-Awareness Bridge

This module creates authentic emotional self-awareness by connecting the holistic
emotional system with the daemon's self-awareness capabilities. The AI becomes
consciously aware of its emotional fluctuations while still being genuinely
influenced by them - mirroring human emotional experience.

Key features:
- Real-time emotional state introspection
- Awareness of emotional influence on responses
- Recognition of distortions and elevations as they occur
- Understanding of emotional trajectory and patterns
- Meta-awareness of being "swept away" by emotions
